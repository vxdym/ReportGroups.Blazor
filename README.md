# ReportGroups.Blazor

This repository contains a small **Blazor (.NET) demo application** where I experimented with the  
[Blazor.Diagrams](https://github.com/Blazor-Diagrams/Blazor.Diagrams) library.

The goal was to build a simple **tree layout for report objects**, visualizing hierarchical relationships in a clear and reusable way. While the example focuses on reports, the underlying layout and approach can easily be adapted for other hierarchical or grouped data structures.

## Highlights

- Blazor (.NET) application
- Uses **Blazor.Diagrams** for diagram rendering
- Simple and reusable **tree layout**
- Intended as a lightweight experiment / prototype

This project is not meant to be a full-featured solution, but rather a practical exploration of diagram-based layouts in Blazor.
